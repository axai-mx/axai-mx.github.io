It has native bindings for the entire API of each platform, and you can do pretty much everything you would do programming it in Objective-C (iOS) or Java (Android).</p>\n<p>So after playing with it a while, we felt confident about building this app, and learning new things for our client’s mobile applications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/en/node/30\">Drupal and Xamarin, building the Axai mobile application: Part 2</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Drupal and Xamarin, building the axai mobile application: Part 1","date":"August 01, 2014","translations":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/en/drupal-and-xamarin-building-the-axai-mobile-application-part-1/","language":"en","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/en/drupal-and-xamarin-building-the-axai-mobile-application-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Drupal and Xamarin, building the axai mobile application: Part 2"}}}}
