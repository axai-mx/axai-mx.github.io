We worked on a deep integration between SAP and their web site developed in Drupal. Users have now, available and updated information about prices and inventories, and different price ranges depending on the roles they have.

We've taken care of some existing Drupal sites, continued the maintenance and even developed new projects with large and complex requirements. Radec is one of the biggest and most important automobile parts distributors in Mexico.
