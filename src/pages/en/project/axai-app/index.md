We created an open source, native, cross platform application for iOS and Android, using Xamarin to compile the code written in C#, the app can be downloaded from the respective mobile stores for each platform.

We configured Drupal and Solr in order to set up the web services that talk to the application, a guide through the process can be found in our [blog section](/en/blog/drupal-and-xamarin-building-the-axai-mobile-application-part-1).

Since this application is open source, the code can be found in [Github](https://github.com/g3r4/Axai-app-XamarinForms), you will need to have Xamarin in order to compile it.
