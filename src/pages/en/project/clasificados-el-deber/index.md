[El Deber](http://www.eldeber.com.bo/), is the most prestigious newspaper in Bolivia, its physical version gets printed millions of times, therefore, its sections are read by a lot of people, Grupo El Deber wanted to take its outreach strategy far beyond the printed version, that is why they decided to bring all their classified ads section to the internet, thus achieving an awesome exposure of the ads, and at the same time, optimize and digitize processes, payments, and moderation.

For this site we developed unique integrations with Bolivia's exclusive payment platforms , we also developed a robust platform of ads moderation, and made integrations with the administrative and fiscal system that Groupo El Deber uses.

The basis of this project is Drupal Commerce, the site is fully responsive for its use in tablets and smartphones, and as a result of the same development, We contributed the [Date Multiselect](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/jackbravo/2417391) module to the Drupal community.
