Gerardo started his career as a web developer in Python (Django) around 2007 in the R&D scene, a couple of years later, he met Drupal, and started working with small local clients for a brief time.

Before becoming involved in Drupal again, he worked for a big company as a software developer engineer, his collaborations were mostly on real time operating systems and driver development for the retail industry.

He crossed paths with Drupal again on axai and now working at [Bixal](http://www.bixal.com), where he develops large scale solutions for national and international clients, contributing patches to Drupal 8 core and getting involved with cross platform and native mobile solutions for new projects.

You can find him on Drupal.org and in IRC as **g3r4**.
